<p>This is the first thing I’ve written on this website. It’s just a
test.</p>

<p>Had a busy workshop today at work where we planned out projects for
the whole team for the year. Afterwards I got a beard trim. When I got
home, Sindu and I ordered sushi for lunch. I got a chicken katsu don and
it was… not good. After that Sindu watched ER and I fucked around on the
computer. That’s pretty much the day!</p>

<p>I gave up my iPad for Lent as I was turning into a bit of an addict
(like some sort of boomer). It’s day two of no iPad and I am realizing I
desperately need a hobby. Probably where this website idea came from
tbh.</p>
