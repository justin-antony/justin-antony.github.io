# Intro

This is the first thing I've written on this website. It's just a test.

## Journal Entry for the Day
Had a busy workshop today at work where we planned out projects for the whole team for the year. Afterwards I got a beard trim. When I got home, Sindu and I ordered sushi for lunch. I got a chicken katsu don and it was... not good. After that Sindu watched ER and I fucked around on the computer. That's pretty much the day!

## Thoughts of the Day
I gave up my iPad for Lent as I was turning into a bit of an addict (like some sort of boomer). It's day two of no iPad and I am realizing I desperately need a hobby. Probably where this website idea came from tbh.
